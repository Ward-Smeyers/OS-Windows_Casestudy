# Pester test

Pester is a testing and mocking framework for PowerShell.

Pester provides a framework for writing and running tests. Pester is most commonly used for writing unit and integration tests, but it is not limited to just that. It is also a base for tools that validate whole environments, computer deployments, database configurations and so on. [Readmore](https://pester.dev/docs/quick-start).

## Describe
A peter test should are structured like this.
```
Describe 'Name of the test' {
    It 'What its checking for' {
    Testscript or command |
    Should Be $true #, $false a number (greater then, less then, equel to )
    }

    # There can be multiple test in 1 Describe.

    It 'What its checking for' {
    Testscript or command |
    Should Be $true
    }
}
```

## NAT networking
Test if the 'Default gateway' add 10.0.2.2 is available if it is that means the NAT network adapter is correctly connected.
```
Test-Connection -ComputerName 10.0.2.2 -Quiet -Count 1 
```

## Internet connection
Test if the google DNS servers are available.
```
Test-Connection -ComputerName 8.8.8.8 -Quiet -Count 1
```

## Check username
Test if the username is present, by geting the localuser list and testing for the name.
```
Get-LocalUser $USERNAME |Select-Object name | should be "@{Name=$USERNAME}"
```

## Firewall
This command geteds the list of firewalls and filters the (Public, private and Domain) and checks if Enabled is true.
```
Get-NetFirewallProfile | where-object {$_.Profile -like "Public"} | Select-Object Enabled | should be "@{Enabled=True}"
```

## Virtual box guest additions
Test if the VirtualBox Guest Additions are installed
```
get-package "Oracle VM VirtualBox Guest Additions 7.0.12"
```

## Grace Period
This command gets the SoftwareLicensingProduct object then looks at the graceperiod in it in days rounds to a full day and tests if ist greater than 0
```
$info = Get-CimInstance -ClassName SoftwareLicensingProduct
[math]::Round($($info.GracePeriodRemaining/24/60), 0) |
should BeGreaterThan 0
```

## Keyboard Layout
I did not get this to work. Where-Object can not filter on Languagetag.
```
Get-WinUserLanguageList | Where-Object {$_.Languagetag -like "nl-BE"}
```
And
```
Get-WinUserLanguageList
```
Return the same list:
```
LanguageTag     : en-BE
Autonym         : English (Belgium)
EnglishName     : English
LocalizedName   : English (Belgium)
ScriptName      : Latin
InputMethodTips : {}
Spellchecking   : True
Handwriting     : False

LanguageTag     : nl-BE
Autonym         : Nederlands (BelgiÃ«)
EnglishName     : Dutch
LocalizedName   : Dutch (Belgium)
ScriptName      : Latin
InputMethodTips : {0813:00000813}
Spellchecking   : True
Handwriting     : False
```

## Package installed
Test if the package Visual Studio Code is installed
```
get-package "Microsoft Visual Studio Code (user)"
